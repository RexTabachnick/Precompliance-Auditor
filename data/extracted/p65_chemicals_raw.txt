SAFE DRINKING WATER AND TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1986

PROPOSITION 65 LIST OF CARCINOGENS OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS

January 3, 2025

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Health and Safety Code section
25249.5 et seq.), also known as Proposition 65, requires that the Governor revise and republish at
least once per year the list of chemicals known to the State to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity
within the meaning of the Act (Health and Safety Code section 25249.8). The list is published in Title
27, California Code of Regulations, section 27001, is provided here, and is available on the website of
the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (oehha.ca.gov).

The identification number indicated in the list is the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry
Number. No CAS number is given when several substances are presented as a single listing or when
a CAS number is not available. The date refers to the initial appearance of the chemical on the list.
For easy reference, chemicals or endpoints shown in strikeout were placed on the list on the date
noted, and have subsequently been removed.
