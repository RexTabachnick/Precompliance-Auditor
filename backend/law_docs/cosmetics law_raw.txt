3 The term ‘adequate substantiation of safety’ means
4 tests or studies, research, analyses, or other evidence
5 or information that is considered, among experts

11 metic product, including any ingredient thereof, is
12 not injurious to users under the conditions of use pre-
13 scribed in the labeling thereof, or under such condi-
14 tions of use as are customary or usual. The Secretary
15 shall not consider a cosmetic ingredient or cosmetic
16 product injurious to users solely because it can cause
17 minor and transient reactions or minor and transient
18 skin irritations in some users. In determining for
19 purposes of this section whether a cosmetic product is
20 safe, the Secretary may consider, as appropriate and
21 available, the cumulative or other relevant exposure to
22 the cosmetic product, including any ingredient there-
23 of.
